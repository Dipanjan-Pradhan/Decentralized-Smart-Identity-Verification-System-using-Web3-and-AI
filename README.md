🛡️ DSIVS — Decentralized Smart Identity & Verification System
A mini full-stack project combining Web3 + AI for secure, decentralized identity storage and verification.

⚡ About
DSIVS (Decentralized Smart Identity & Verification System) is a student-led project from KIIT University for the Web3 X AI BootCamp 2025. It demonstrates how Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence can work together to solve real-world trust problems like identity fraud and fake credentials.

✅ Web3: Stores hashed identity proofs on a blockchain, ensuring data integrity and user ownership.
✅ AI: Verifies user identity using simple facial detection before storing any data.
✅ Full-stack: Combines smart contracts, a Python AI service, a Node.js backend, and a React frontend.

🎯 Key Features
Store tamper-proof identity hashes on-chain using a Solidity smart contract.

Verify uploaded user photos with AI (OpenCV face detection).

Connects all parts via a simple React app + Express backend.

Runs locally with easy-to-follow steps — perfect for learning!
